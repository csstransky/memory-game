Web Dev Fall 2018 HW04 Status

Answer the following questions:

1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/csstransky/memory-game


3. What's the version number of your github release?



4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
hw05.cstransky.me



5. Is your game functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Yes, everything works perfectly (though I really wanted to get genServer 
working with this).

Note: You get +1 to your score for every miss match. Getting a match won't
affect your score.

Note: You can click the board during a mismatch to speed up the delay and
instantly start playing again.


6. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes.



7. How did you handle cards flipping back after a set timeout?
After 1 second, the cards will come back. Clicking during the timeout delay
will speed it up.

I originally wanted to use genServer to handle flipbacks, but I had to settle
with using Javascript, and tacking on two more objects onto my elixir game 
state (the value of the two panels being flipped back). For whatever reason,
my application.ex would not let me start the Memory.GameServer child process.
